      Ashkaan Jaberi here aka "JS slayer". Personally, I can not stand the foam soap, I’m all aboard team liquid soap. Also, I can’t recommend it enough to everyone to make the switch to “wet ones” as a toilet paper alternative (when needed).  You’ll wonder how you lived your life up to this point without having used them.  On top of liquid soap and some wet ones, my unicorn would also have a bedet.  When I become King of everything the light touches, my first royal proclomation will be to have them installed in all toilets across the land.
